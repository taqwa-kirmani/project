In this project, I have created a Netflix Clone. Netflix is a popular online video entertainment website, where a person can watch unlimited movies and TV shows. The tech stack used to create this project includes, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used modern CSS techniques like Flex, overlays, etc. Document Object Model(DOM) is used in the JavaScript code.
There are three code files in the netflix_clone folder:
index.html contains the HTML code. The sub-foler src contains styles.css is the CSS file and index.js is the JavaScript file.
